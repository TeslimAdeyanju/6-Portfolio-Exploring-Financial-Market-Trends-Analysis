    "Feature engineering is a critical step in building robust machine learning models for stock price analysis. It involves creating relevant and informative features from raw data to enhance the predictive performance of the model. In this analysis, we focus on generating features from `technical indicators` and `fundamental metrics`. These features capture essential aspects of stock market behavior, offering insights into trends, volatility, and financial health.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Technical Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical indicators are mathematical calculations derived from historical price, volume, or other market data to provide insights into market trends, momentum, volatility, and volume. These indicators are essential for understanding market behavior and identifying potential opportunities for trading or investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Categories of Technical Indicators\n",
    "\t1.\t**Trend Indicators**: These indicators identify the direction of market movements and help traders determine whether a market is in an uptrend, downtrend, or consolidating. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Moving Averages (MA)`: Smooths out price data to identify trends over time.\n",
    "\t\t- `Exponential Moving Average (EMA)`: Gives more weight to recent prices for faster responses to price changes.\n",
    "\t\t- `MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)`: Highlights changes in momentum and trend direction.\n",
    "\t\t- `Parabolic SAR`: Indicates potential reversals in market trends.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "\t2.\t**Momentum Indicators**: These indicators measure the speed and strength of price movements, helping traders identify overbought or oversold conditions. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Relative Strength Index (RSI)`: Measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions.\n",
    "\t\t- `Stochastic Oscillator`: Compares a security's closing price to its price range over a specific period.\n",
    "\t\t- `Rate of Change (ROC)`: Measures the percentage change in price between the current price and a past price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t3.\t**Volatility Indicators**: These indicators quantify the degree of price fluctuations in the market, helping traders assess risk and potential price movements. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Bollinger Bands`: Consist of a moving average and two standard deviation bands to identify price volatility.\n",

    "\t\t- `Keltner Channels`: Similar to Bollinger Bands, but use average true range to set channel boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t4.\t**Volume Indicators**: These indicators analyze trading volume to assess the strength of price movements and identify potential reversals. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `On-Balance Volume (OBV)`: Tracks cumulative volume to predict price movements.\n",
    "\t\t- `Accumulation/Distribution Line`: Combines price and volume data to assess the flow of money in and out of a security.\n",
    "\t\t- `Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)`: Measures the buying and selling pressure for a security.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fundamental Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to technical indicators, fundamental metrics provide valuable insights into a company's financial health, performance, and valuation. These metrics are derived from financial statements, earnings reports, and other fundamental data sources, offering a comprehensive view of a company's operations and prospects. By incorporating fundamental metrics into our feature set, we can enhance the predictive power of our machine learning models and gain a deeper understanding of the factors driving stock price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental metrics are quantitative data points derived from a company's financial statements, earnings reports, and other fundamental data sources. These metrics provide insights into a company's financial health, performance, valuation, and growth prospects, helping investors make informed decisions about stock investments. By analyzing fundamental metrics, investors can assess the intrinsic value of a company, evaluate its competitive position, and identify potential investment opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Categories of Fundamental Metrics\n",
    "\t1.\t**Valuation Metrics**: These metrics assess the relative value of a company's stock by comparing its market price to fundamental indicators such as earnings, book value, and cash flow. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio`: Compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share to evaluate valuation.\n",
    "\t\t- `Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio`: Compares a company's stock price to its book value per share to assess valuation.\n",
    "\t\t- `Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio`: Compares a company's stock price to its revenue per share to evaluate valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t2.\t**Profitability Metrics**: These metrics measure a company's ability to generate profits and manage costs effectively. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Return on Equity (ROE)`: Measures a company's profitability by evaluating its return on shareholders' equity.\n",
    "\t\t- `Net Profit Margin`: Measures the percentage of revenue that translates into profit after accounting for expenses.\n",
    "\t\t- `Operating Margin`: Measures the percentage of revenue that translates into profit after accounting for operating expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t3.\t**Growth Metrics**: These metrics assess a company's growth prospects and potential for future expansion. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Revenue Growth Rate`: Measures the percentage increase in a company's revenue over a specific period.\n",
    "\t\t- `Earnings Growth Rate`: Measures the percentage increase in a company's earnings over a specific period.\n",
    "\t\t- `Dividend Yield`: Measures the percentage of dividends paid relative to a company's stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t4.\t**Financial Health Metrics**: These metrics evaluate a company's financial stability, liquidity, and debt levels. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Debt-to-Equity Ratio`: Measures a company's debt relative to its equity to assess financial leverage.\n",
    "\t\t- `Current Ratio`: Measures a company's ability to cover short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.\n",

    "According to research by Dr. P. H. Zope, published in the International Journal of Research Publication and Reviews (Vol. 4, No. 6, June 2023), the moving average is a widely recognized tool in time series analysis for identifying long-term trends by smoothing out short-term price fluctuations.  This technique helps filter market noise, enabling a clearer understanding of underlying price trends. The study compares three key methods—Simple Moving Average (SMA), Weighted Moving Average (WMA), and Exponential Moving Average (EMA)—highlighting their effectiveness in forecasting stock prices. Among these, the moving average based on a 20-day period is particularly noted for its utility in stock price prediction due to its balance of responsiveness and trend stability. Thus, 20 days moving average is selected as a key feature for trend analysis.\n",

    "2. **`MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence):`**  \n",
    "The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a widely utilized momentum indicator in technical analysis, designed to identify changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend in a stock's price. It achieves this by calculating the difference between short-term and long-term exponential moving averages (EMAs) of closing prices. The standard parameters for MACD are typically set as follows:\n",
    "- Fast Period (12): This parameter represents the short-term EMA, capturing recent price movements to reflect the latest market sentiment.   \n",
    "- Slow Period (26): This denotes the long-term EMA, smoothing out price fluctuations to highlight the overarching trend.    \n",
    "- Signal Period (9): This is the EMA of the MACD line itself, serving as a trigger for buy or sell signals based on its crossover with the MACD line.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The MACD indicator, as discussed in the International Journal of Engineering Research and Technology (IJERT), is a powerful tool for identifying trend reversals and momentum shifts in stock prices. By comparing two moving averages, the MACD provides insights into the strength and direction of price movements, enabling traders to make informed decisions. The study highlights the MACD's effectiveness in predicting stock price movements and its utility in technical analysis. Thus, the MACD is selected as a key feature for trend analysis.\n",

    "The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a popular momentum oscillator that measures the speed and magnitude of recent price movements, identifying overbought or oversold conditions in a stock. The RSI is calculated based on the average gain and loss over a specified period, typically 14 days. The RSI ranges from 0 to 100, with values above 70 indicating overbought conditions and values below 30 indicating oversold conditions. The RSI is a valuable tool for detecting potential reversals and trend changes in stock prices, providing insights into market sentiment and momentum. \n",

It consists of a moving average (typically a 20-day SMA) and two standard deviation bands above and below the moving average. The bands expand and contract based on market volatility, providing insights into price movements and potential trend reversals. Bollinger Bands are particularly useful for identifying extreme price movements and assessing market conditions. \n",

It is designed to identify buying and selling pressure in the market by analyzing the flow of money into and out of a security. The OBV indicator is calculated by adding the trading volume on days when the price closes higher and subtracting the volume on days when the price closes lower. By evaluating the relationship between volume and price movements, the OBV indicator provides early signals of potential trend reversals and market sentiment.\n",
