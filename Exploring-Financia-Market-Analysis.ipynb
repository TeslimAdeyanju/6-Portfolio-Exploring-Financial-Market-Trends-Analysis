    "Feature engineering is a critical step in building robust machine learning models for stock price analysis. It involves creating relevant and informative features from raw data to enhance the predictive performance of the model. In this analysis, we focus on generating features from `technical indicators` and `fundamental metrics`. These features capture essential aspects of stock market behavior, offering insights into trends, volatility, and financial health.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Technical Indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical indicators are mathematical calculations derived from historical price, volume, or other market data to provide insights into market trends, momentum, volatility, and volume. These indicators are essential for understanding market behavior and identifying potential opportunities for trading or investment.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Categories of Technical Indicators\n",
    "\t1.\t**Trend Indicators**: These indicators identify the direction of market movements and help traders determine whether a market is in an uptrend, downtrend, or consolidating. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Moving Averages (MA)`: Smooths out price data to identify trends over time.\n",
    "\t\t- `Exponential Moving Average (EMA)`: Gives more weight to recent prices for faster responses to price changes.\n",
    "\t\t- `MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)`: Highlights changes in momentum and trend direction.\n",
    "\t\t- `Parabolic SAR`: Indicates potential reversals in market trends.\t\n",
    "\n",
    "\t2.\t**Momentum Indicators**: These indicators measure the speed and strength of price movements, helping traders identify overbought or oversold conditions. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Relative Strength Index (RSI)`: Measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate overbought or oversold conditions.\n",
    "\t\t- `Stochastic Oscillator`: Compares a security's closing price to its price range over a specific period.\n",
    "\t\t- `Rate of Change (ROC)`: Measures the percentage change in price between the current price and a past price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t3.\t**Volatility Indicators**: These indicators quantify the degree of price fluctuations in the market, helping traders assess risk and potential price movements. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Bollinger Bands`: Consist of a moving average and two standard deviation bands to identify price volatility.\n",
    "\t\t- `Average True Range (ATR)`: Measures market volatility by calculating the average range between price highs and lows.\n",
    "\t\t- `Keltner Channels`: Similar to Bollinger Bands, but use average true range to set channel boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t4.\t**Volume Indicators**: These indicators analyze trading volume to assess the strength of price movements and identify potential reversals. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `On-Balance Volume (OBV)`: Tracks cumulative volume to predict price movements.\n",
    "\t\t- `Accumulation/Distribution Line`: Combines price and volume data to assess the flow of money in and out of a security.\n",
    "\t\t- `Chaikin Money Flow (CMF)`: Measures the buying and selling pressure for a security.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Fundamental Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to technical indicators, fundamental metrics provide valuable insights into a company's financial health, performance, and valuation. These metrics are derived from financial statements, earnings reports, and other fundamental data sources, offering a comprehensive view of a company's operations and prospects. By incorporating fundamental metrics into our feature set, we can enhance the predictive power of our machine learning models and gain a deeper understanding of the factors driving stock price movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fundamental metrics are quantitative data points derived from a company's financial statements, earnings reports, and other fundamental data sources. These metrics provide insights into a company's financial health, performance, valuation, and growth prospects, helping investors make informed decisions about stock investments. By analyzing fundamental metrics, investors can assess the intrinsic value of a company, evaluate its competitive position, and identify potential investment opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Categories of Fundamental Metrics\n",
    "\t1.\t**Valuation Metrics**: These metrics assess the relative value of a company's stock by comparing its market price to fundamental indicators such as earnings, book value, and cash flow. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio`: Compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share to evaluate valuation.\n",
    "\t\t- `Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio`: Compares a company's stock price to its book value per share to assess valuation.\n",
    "\t\t- `Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio`: Compares a company's stock price to its revenue per share to evaluate valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t2.\t**Profitability Metrics**: These metrics measure a company's ability to generate profits and manage costs effectively. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Return on Equity (ROE)`: Measures a company's profitability by evaluating its return on shareholders' equity.\n",
    "\t\t- `Net Profit Margin`: Measures the percentage of revenue that translates into profit after accounting for expenses.\n",
    "\t\t- `Operating Margin`: Measures the percentage of revenue that translates into profit after accounting for operating expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t3.\t**Growth Metrics**: These metrics assess a company's growth prospects and potential for future expansion. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Revenue Growth Rate`: Measures the percentage increase in a company's revenue over a specific period.\n",
    "\t\t- `Earnings Growth Rate`: Measures the percentage increase in a company's earnings over a specific period.\n",
    "\t\t- `Dividend Yield`: Measures the percentage of dividends paid relative to a company's stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t4.\t**Financial Health Metrics**: These metrics evaluate a company's financial stability, liquidity, and debt levels. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Debt-to-Equity Ratio`: Measures a company's debt relative to its equity to assess financial leverage.\n",
    "\t\t- `Current Ratio`: Measures a company's ability to cover short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.\n",
    "\t\t- `Interest Coverage Ratio`: Measures a company's ability to pay interest on its debt with its earnings.\n",

    "In addition to technical indicators, fundamental metrics provide valuable insights into a company's financial health, performance, and valuation. These metrics are derived from financial statements, earnings reports, and other fundamental data sources, offering a comprehensive view of a company's operations and prospects. By incorporating fundamental metrics into our feature set, we can enhance the predictive power of our machine learning models and gain a deeper understanding of the factors driving stock price movements.\n",

    "Fundamental metrics are quantitative data points derived from a company's financial statements, earnings reports, and other fundamental data sources. These metrics provide insights into a company's financial health, performance, valuation, and growth prospects, helping investors make informed decisions about stock investments. By analyzing fundamental metrics, investors can assess the intrinsic value of a company, evaluate its competitive position, and identify potential investment opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Categories of Fundamental Metrics\n",
    "\t1.\t**Valuation Metrics**: These metrics assess the relative value of a company's stock by comparing its market price to fundamental indicators such as earnings, book value, and cash flow. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio`: Compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share to evaluate valuation.\n",
    "\t\t- `Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio`: Compares a company's stock price to its book value per share to assess valuation.\n",
    "\t\t- `Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio`: Compares a company's stock price to its revenue per share to evaluate valuation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t2.\t**Profitability Metrics**: These metrics measure a company's ability to generate profits and manage costs effectively. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Return on Equity (ROE)`: Measures a company's profitability by evaluating its return on shareholders' equity.\n",
    "\t\t- `Net Profit Margin`: Measures the percentage of revenue that translates into profit after accounting for expenses.\n",
    "\t\t- `Operating Margin`: Measures the percentage of revenue that translates into profit after accounting for operating expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t3.\t**Growth Metrics**: These metrics assess a company's growth prospects and potential for future expansion. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Revenue Growth Rate`: Measures the percentage increase in a company's revenue over a specific period.\n",
    "\t\t- `Earnings Growth Rate`: Measures the percentage increase in a company's earnings over a specific period.\n",
    "\t\t- `Dividend Yield`: Measures the percentage of dividends paid relative to a company's stock price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\t4.\t**Financial Health Metrics**: These metrics evaluate a company's financial stability, liquidity, and debt levels. Examples include:\n",
    "\t\t- `Debt-to-Equity Ratio`: Measures a company's debt relative to its equity to assess financial leverage.\n",
    "\t\t- `Current Ratio`: Measures a company's ability to cover short-term liabilities with its short-term assets.\n",
    "\t\t- `Interest Coverage Ratio`: Measures a company's ability to pay interest on its debt with its earnings."
